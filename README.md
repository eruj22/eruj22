## ðŸš€ About Me

Ever since I stumbled into the world of programming, I've been hooked on building amazing websites with eye-catching animations. Over time, I ventured into creating more complex and user-friendly applications. What really gets me excited is the endless creativity that coding allows and the impact it has on people's lives.

Before landing my first job, I tinkered with various projects showcased on my GitHub profile. While learning React, I was fortunate to have <a href="https://github.com/artnerdnet">artnerdnet</a> as my mentor. Her feedback was a game-changer, pushing me to become a better coder.

When I finally got hired after a year of learning, I jumped into client projects with an agile team. Collaborating with developers, designers, testers, writers and product managers, we built a central file management system that's now a crucial part of a bigger software package. With amazing mentorship, I quickly picked up good coding habits that shaped how I develop software.

Less than two years later, I was ready for a new challenge. I made the switch from React to Angular as my main tool. It was tough at first, but I love a good challenge. With persistence and help from my mentor, I soon got the hang of Angular. It's been an exciting journey of growth and learning.
