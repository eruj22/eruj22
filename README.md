## ðŸš€ About Me

Ever since I stumbled upon programming I was inspired to build cool web-apps and to learn as much as I could. It's fascinating what you can do with well written code. Possibilies are endless. What keeps me going is a constant challenge when writing code and it's impact on the people using the software.

Before getting my first job I had built many different projects that you can see on my GitHub profile. During my first few months of learning React I had a pleasure to learn from <a href="https://github.com/artnerdnet">artnerdnet</a>. She was my mentor and she helped me immensely with her feedback on my written code. Her guidance through extensive knowledge and experience helped me progress faster than I would otherwise.

Currently I am working as a front-end developer in a team, surrounded with more knowledgeable and experienced people. We are building central file handling widget called File manager. Our users went from having to upload a file in different places where using it to reusing it from the File manager. We have addressed huge painpoint of our users and we keep adding new features to empower our users even more.

In the day to day I am using React, TypeScript, Emotion, Tanstack query and Jest.
