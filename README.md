## ðŸš€ About Me

Ever since I stumbled upon programming I was inspired to build more, to learn more, to be better programmer. 
Before getting my first job I had built many different projects that you can see on my GitHub profile. During my first few months of learning React I had a pleasure to learn from <a href="https://github.com/artnerdnet">artnerdnet</a>. She was my mentor and she helped me immensely with her feedback on my written code. Her guidance through extensive knowledge and experience helped me progress faster than I would otherwise.

Currently I am working as a front-end developer in a team, where I am surrounded with knowledgeable and experienced people. In the day to day I am using React, TypeScript, Emotion, React query and Jest.
