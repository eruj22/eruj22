## ðŸš€ About Me

Ever since I stumbled upon programming I was inspired to build more, to learn more, to be better programmer. 
For me it's simple. Do something programming related every day. Untill now I have built many projects, from really simple to less simple ones. Most of them you can find on GitHub.

Last few months I am actively learning React through building projects. I am also very grateful to get React mentor, <a href="https://github.com/artnerdnet">artnerdnet</a>. She helped me improve my code and guided me through different issues. With her help I have became better programmer.

In my personal life I love doing sports, reading, listening to music and enjoying the nature.
