## ðŸš€ About Me

Ever since I stumbled upon programming I was inspired to build more, to learn more, to be better programmer. It's fascinating what you can do with well written code. Possibilies are endless. What keeps me going is a constant challenge when writing code and the impact it has on the people using it.

Before getting my first job I had built many different projects that you can see on my GitHub profile. During my first few months of learning React I had a pleasure to learn from <a href="https://github.com/artnerdnet">artnerdnet</a>. She was my mentor and she helped me immensely with her feedback on my written code. Her guidance through extensive knowledge and experience helped me progress faster than I would otherwise.

Currently I am working as a front-end developer in a team, surrounded with knowledgeable and experienced people. We are building central file handling widget called File manager. Our users went from having to upload the file in every place it was used to having it inside File manager and reusing it. We have addressed huge painpoint of our users.

In the day to day I am using React, TypeScript, Emotion, Tanstack query and Jest.
